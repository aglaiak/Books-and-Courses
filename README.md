# Books-and-Courses
Programming self-learning route 

This is a long journey dedicated in self-learning Bioinformatics by using books and courses/bootcamps. 
The books chosen are the fuel for keeping me motivated in achieving the ultimate goal of becoming a Bioinformatician/Data Scientist in Life Sciences. 

I am very excited for starting this journey and this repo will serve as tracking tool of how much I have progressed in learning. <br>
